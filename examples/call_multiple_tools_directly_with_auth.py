"""Example script demonstrating how to call multiple tools directly with authentication.

For this example, we are using the prebuilt Spotify toolkit to start playing similar songs to the currently playing song.

Steps:
1. Get the currently playing song
2. Get audio features for the currently playing song
3. Get song recommendations that are similar to the currently playing song
4. Start playing the recommended songs
5. Inform the user which recommended song is now playing
