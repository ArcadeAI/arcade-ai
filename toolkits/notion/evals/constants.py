SMALL_PAGE_CONTENT = """## Why Build Tools with Arcade?

Arcade solves key challenges for agent developers:

1. **Auth Native to Agents**: Authentication designed for agentic workflows â€” the right token is always available for each user without complex integration work.

2. **Multi-Tenant Tool Calling**: Enable your agent to take actions AS the specific user of the agent

3. **Better Agent Capabilities**: Build tools that securely connect to the services your users want your agent to integrate with (Gmail, Slack, Google Drive, Zoom, etc.) without complex integration code.

4. **Clean Codebase**: Eliminate environment variables full of API keys and complex OAuth implementations from your application code.

5. **Flexible Integration**: Choose your integration approach:

    - LLM API for the simplest experience with hundreds of pre-built tools
    - Tools API for direct execution control
    - Auth API for authentication-only integration
    - Framework connectors for LangChain, CrewAI and others

6. **Zero Schema Maintenance**: Tool definitions generate automatically from code annotations and translate to any LLM format.

7. **Built-in Evaluation**: Evaluate your tools across user scenarios, llms, and context with Arcade's tool calling evaluation framework. Ensure your tools are working as expected and are useful for your agents.

8. **Complete Tooling Ecosystem**: Built-in evaluation framework, scalable execution infrastructure, and flexible deployment options (including VPC, Docker, and Kubernetes).

Arcade lets you focus on creating useful tool functionality rather than solving complex authentication, deployment, and integration challenges.
