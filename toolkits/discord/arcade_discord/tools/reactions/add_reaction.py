    Add an emoji reaction to a Discord message.

    This tool adds a reaction emoji to a specified message. You can use either standard
    Unicode emojis (like "üëç" or "‚ù§Ô∏è") or custom Discord emojis (using their ID in the
    format "name:id").

    Message reactions are useful for creating polls, allowing quick feedback, building
    role-assignment systems, or simply expressing emotion in response to a message.

    Examples:
    - Add a thumbs up reaction to acknowledge a suggestion
    - React with a check mark to indicate approval of a proposal
    - Create a poll by adding multiple reaction options to a message
    - Add a custom server emoji to welcome new members

    Returns a dictionary containing:
    - channel_id: ID of the channel containing the message
    - message_id: ID of the message that was reacted to
    - emoji: The emoji that was added as a reaction
    - success: Boolean indicating if the reaction was successfully added

    Remove an emoji reaction from a Discord message.

    This tool removes a reaction emoji from a specified message. You can remove either
    your bot's own reaction or a specific user's reaction (if you have the MANAGE_MESSAGES
    permission).

    Removing reactions is useful for cleaning up polls after they're completed, managing
    reaction-based role systems, or controlling the available options in a menu.

    Examples:
    - Remove your bot's checkmark reaction after a request is processed
    - Clean up a user's reaction in a controlled reaction-role system
    - Remove all instances of a specific reaction from a poll that has ended
    - Take away inappropriate reactions added by users

    Returns a dictionary containing:
    - channel_id: ID of the channel containing the message
    - message_id: ID of the message that had the reaction removed
    - emoji: The emoji that was removed as a reaction
    - user_id: ID of the user whose reaction was removed (if specified)

    This tool retrieves all users who have added a specific reaction to a message. If no

    in a reaction-based system, or analyzing engagement with a message.

    - Count votes in a reaction-based poll
    - Check which users have signed up via a reaction
