# This workflow prevents unauthorized updates to existing toolkit versions,
# as well as unauthorized renames or removals of toolkits.
# Toolkits are versioned via the `toolkits/*/pyproject.toml` file.
# It ensures that only members or owners of the ArcadeAI organization
# can modify existing toolkit versions, rename, or remove toolkits.
# If a pull request is made by someone outside the organization, the workflow
# will fail if any existing toolkit version is changed, or if a toolkit is renamed or removed.
